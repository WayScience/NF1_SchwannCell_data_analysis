# 0.data_analysis
This module focuses on exploring relationships in the cell morphology data.
We organize this module into two correlation analyses:

1. `plate_5_characteristics` explores similarities between genotype groups using cell morphologies aggregated to the well-level, post-feature selection.
2. `all_plates_characteristics` explores similarities between the wells of plates 3, 3 prime, and 5 using genotype and seeding density groups.
