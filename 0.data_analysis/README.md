# 0.data_analysis
This module focuses on exploring relationships in the cell morphology data.
We organize this module into the following analyses:

- `plate_correlation_analyses` explores similarities between aggregated well morphology feature, post feature selection, using genotype and plate groups.
- `plate_eda_analyses` explores the NF1 plate data.
