# 0.data_analysis
This module focuses on exploring relationships in cell morphology data not included in the [nf1_cellpainting_data](https://github.com/WayScience/nf1_cellpainting_data) repository.
We organize this module into two correlation analyses:

1. `plate_5_characteristics` explores similarities between genotype groups using cell morphologies aggregated to the well-level, post-feature selection.
2. `all_plates_characteristics` explores similarities between the wells of plates 3, 3 prime, 4, and 5 using genotype and seeding density groups.
