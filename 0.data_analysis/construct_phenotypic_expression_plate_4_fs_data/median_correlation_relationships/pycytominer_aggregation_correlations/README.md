# Aggregate Correlation Analysis
In this analysis, the effect of different treatments on aggregated cell expression were compared, these treatments can be summarized as follows:
- siRNA constructs 1 and 2 target the mRNA of the NF1 gene.
- Scramble is a random siRNA sequence.
- No Treatment is the state without any perturbation

### Correlation Comparisons
Aggregated pairwise correlations were calculated across wells between:
- The same siRNA constructs within each construct concentration
- Different siRNA constructs within each construct concentration

### Visualzing Comparisons
Correlations were then plotted as boxplots for each concentration in the following groups:

- (Construct 1) and (Construct 2)
- (Construct 1) and (Constrcut 1)
- (Construct 2) and (Construct 2)
- (Construct 1) and (Scramble)
- (Construct 2) and (Scramble)
- (Scramble) and (Scramble)
- (Construct 1) and (No Treatment)
- (Construct 2) and (No Treatment)
- (Scramble) and (No Treatment)
- (No Treatment) and (No Treatment)
