# Median Correlation Analysis
In this analysis, the median values across all features were determined for all cells in each well. The aggreated features were then compared across replicates:
### Correlation Comparisons
Aggregated pairwise correlations were calculated across well between:
- The same siRNA constructs within each construct concentration
- Different siRNA constructs within each construct concentration

Correlations were then plotted and compared by estimating the pdfs using kde for each construct concentration for the above groups.
