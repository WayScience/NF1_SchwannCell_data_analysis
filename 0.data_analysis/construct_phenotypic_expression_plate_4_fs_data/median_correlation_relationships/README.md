# Median Correlation Analysis
In this analysis, the median values across all features were determined for all cells in each well. The aggreated features were then compared across groups:
### Correlation Comparisons
Aggregated pairwise correlations were calculated across well between:
- The same siRNA constructs within each construct concentration
- Different siRNA constructs within each construct concentration

The `no_treatment` wells were only compared with other `no_treatment` wells for this analysis.

### Visualzing Comparisons
Correlations were then plotted as boxplots for each concentration in the following groups:

- (Construct 1) and (Construct 2)
- (Construct 1) and (Constrcut 1)
- (Construct 2) and (Construct 2)
- (Construct 1) and (Scramble)
- (Construct 2) and (Scramble)
