# Median Correlation Analysis
In this analysis the single cell features were compared across groups:
### Correlation Comparisons
Pairwise correlations between cells were calculated across wells between:
- The same siRNA constructs within each construct concentration
- Different siRNA constructs within each construct concentration

### Visualzing Comparisons
Correlations were then plotted as boxplots for each concentration in the following groups:

- (Construct 1) and (Construct 2)
- (Construct 1) and (Constrcut 1)
- (Construct 2) and (Construct 2)
- (Construct 1) and (Scramble)
- (Construct 2) and (Scramble)
- (Scramble) and (Scramble)
- (Construct 1) and (No Treatment)
- (Construct 2) and (No Treatment)
- (Scramble) and (No Treatment)
- (No Treatment) and (No Treatment)
