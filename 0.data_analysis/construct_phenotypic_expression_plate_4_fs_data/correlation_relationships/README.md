# Correlation Analysis
In this analysis, the features values were compared for all cells for the following groups:
### Correlation Comparisons
Pairwise correlations were calculated for the following groups:
- Across Well within each construct concentration
    - For the same siRNA constructs
    - For different siRNA constructs

- Within Well for each siRNA construct and construct concentration

Correlations were then plotted and compared by estimating the pdfs using kde for each construct concentration for the above groups.
