# NF1 Schwann cell data analysis

We aim to characterize cell morphology signatures of neurofibromin in Schwann cells. 
We applied a modified Cell Painting assay on two isogenic Schwann cell lines, one of the wildtype genotype (*NF1+/+*) and one of the null genotype (*NF1-/-*), both from the same patient.
The modified assay stains for four organelles: nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and actin. 
We applied CellProfiler pipelines to perform quality control, illumination correction, segmentation, and feature extraction.

The scale bar represents 25 Î¼M. (B) The workflow of our analysis pipeline demonstrates the steps taken from image analysis to machine learning

We segmented 22,585 wild-type (WT) and null cells across three plates and utilized 907 significant morphology features representing various organelle shapes and intensity patterns. 

We trained a logistic regression binary classifier to predict the NF1 genotype of single cells. 
The model shows high performance with with accuracy of 0.85 and 0.80 for the training and testing data splits respectively.

Applying the model to a shuffled dataset performed worse than the non-shuffled data, demonstrating a biological signal between genotypes. (B) Confusion matrices from the training and testing data splits show higher performance across genotypes in non-shuffled data compared to the shuffled data. (C) Accuracy scores show high performance classifying cells with both genotypes from the training and testing data splits compared to shuffled data. Both panels B and C visualize the results from the optimized model.

We look to improve upon this preliminary model in the future. 
We aim to generate further data which includes the heterozygous genotype (*NF1+/-*).
AS well, we plan to apply an improved model to large-scale drug screens to capture candidate drugs that make NF1 patient cells look healthy.

**NOTE:** All image analysis and image-based profiling pipelines can be found in the [nf1_cellpainting_data](https://github.com/WayScience/NF1_SchwannCell_data_analysis) repository.

## Repository Structure

This analysis is categorized as follows:

| Module | Purpose | Description |
| :---- | :----- | :---------- |
| [0.data_analysis](./0.data_analysis/) | Preliminary analysis of NF1 data | We find interesting patterns in the NF1 cell morphology data. |
| [1.train_models](./1.train_models/) | Train NF1 models | Optimize the NF1 model by training multiple models with a random search. |
| [2.evaluate_models](./2.evaluate_models/) | Evaluate final NF1 model | After training the final NF1 model, we extract the model performance and model feature importances. |
| [3.figures](./3.figures/) | Generate manuscript figures | We interpret the results from the model by generating figures to include in the manuscript. |

## Steps to reproduce

### Step 1. Clone the analysis repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/WayScience/NF1_SchwannCell_data_analysis.git
```

### Step 2. Change the current path to the repo path

### Step 3. Populate the nf1_data_repo folder from the NF1_SchwannCell_data repo

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Step 4. Create the conda environments

There are two different environments used in this analysis:

1. [environment.yml](./environment.yml): A Python-based environment meant for performing model training, evaluation, and image montage generation.
2. [figure_environment.yml](./figure_environment.yml): An R-based environment meant for generating figures.

```sh
conda env create ...
```
