# Creating supplemental figure 2 - Image quality control distributions

To generate the second supplemental figure of the manuscript, there is one step to follow:

1. [SuppFigure2_qualitycontrol.ipynb](./SuppFigure2_qualitycontrol.ipynb): Generate distribution plots for blur and saturation metrics across plate, and patch the plots together to make one figure.

All steps can be ran with the bash script using the command below:

```bash
source supp_figure_2.sh
```
