# Creating main figure 3 - Model evaluation results

To generate the third main figure of the manuscript, there is one step to follow:

1. [main_figure_3.ipynb](./main_figure_3.ipynb): Load in evaluation results, generate plots, and patch together to make one figure.

All steps can be ran with the bash script using the command below:

```bash
source main_figure_3.sh
```
